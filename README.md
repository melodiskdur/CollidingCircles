## Setup and build
The current setup & build approach builds only for Windows and requires Visual Studio 16 2019. This will be more generalized in the future. If you have
another version of Visual Studio installed, you can edit "runcmake.ps1" and change the version manually.

In the Powershell command line, simply run

```shell
.\runcmake.ps1
.\build.ps1
```
